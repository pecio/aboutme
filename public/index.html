        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ra&uacute;l Pedroche.
          <img src="images/raulete.jpeg" alt="[My portrait]"/>
          Pleased to meet you.
          I am another student of
          <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/"
            title="A Ruby Learning Hub">RubyLearning.org</a>'s
          course "Programming for the Web with Ruby".</p>
        <p>I like to be known by the handle "Pecio", but, truth be told,
          nobody ever calls me that.</p>
        <p>I have
          <a href="http://raulete.tumblr.com/"
            title="Raulete's rants about technology and everything">a
            Tumblr web log</a> that I do not update too much and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pedrocheisback"
            title="Raúl Pedroche (pedrocheisback) in Twitter">a
            Twitter feed</a> that I update somewhat more but is not
          too thrilling to read.</p>
          <div><a class="map" href="images/map.png"><img
          src="images/map-thumbnail.png" alt="[Map of my location]"/></a></div>
      <p>I am from Spain. I was raised in the northern coast, but
        now I am living in the capital, Madrid, in the center of the
        Iberian peninsula.</p>
      <p>I am an unix administrator by training and trade, although I am
      currently between jobs. I am using this free time to try to learn
      more about programming. That is why I am taking Rubylearning.org
      course.</p>
      <p>A confession: I am a Ruby newbie (although this is not my first
        contact with the language). But I think I am getting up to
        speed fairly well.</p>
      <p>I learnt Object Oriented programming quite a long
        time ago (my main source was <a href="http://goo.gl/yZQN8"
        title="Object-oriented programming: an evolutionary approach">a book</a>
      that used Objective-C back when nobody had heard of the
      language) and I have tried to use the paradigm everytime I
      have had to write some program. I have done OO programming
      in C++, Perl, and Objective-C (with Cocoa) and have used OO
      architectures in plain ANSI C.</p>
      <p>Besides this course, I am doing a course on C# development. And
      it is like night and day. Quite often, while doing the exercises on C#,
      I cannot help but think how much easier and intuitive would it be in
      Ruby (or maybe any dynamic language).</p>
      <p>(That and the fact I miss Vim, although Intellisense is great.)</p>
      <p>It can be said I am under the influence of the Apple sect: my
      computers are Apple (besides a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_5/10"
        title="Ultra 5/10 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Sun Ultra 10
      workstation</a> I do not power on too
      often) and I have an iPhone. Although I do not have plans of buying
      an iPad (I have no use for it).</p>
      <p>I suppose I have to talk about my hobbies. I am quite boring in
      that respect. I read books (mostly science fiction, but not
      exclusively), watch movies from time to time and listen to rock
      music.</p>
