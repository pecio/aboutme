    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ra&uacute;l.</p>
    <p>I am from Spain. I was raised in the northern coast, but now I
am living in the capital, Madrid, in the center of the Iberian peninsula.</p>
    <a href="images/map.png"><img src="images/map-thumbnail.png"/></a>
    <p>I am an unix administrator by training and trade, although I am
currently between jobs. I am using this free time to try to learn more
about programming. That is why I am taking Rubylearning.com course.</p>
    <p>A confession: I am a Ruby newbie. But I think I am getting up to
speed fairly well.</p>
    <p>I learnt Object Oriented programming quite a long
time ago (my main source was a book that used Objective-C back when
nobody had heard of the language) and I have tried to use the paradigm
everytime I have had to write some program. I have done OO programming
in C++, Perl, and Objective-C (with Cocoa). And have used OO architectures
in plain ANSI C.</p>
    <p>Besides this course, I am doing a course on C# development. And
it is like night and day. Quite often, while doing the exercises on C#,
I cannot help but think how much easier and intuitive would it be in
Ruby (or maybe any dynamic language).</p>
    <p>(That and the fact I miss Vim, although Intellisense is great.)</p>
    <p>It can be said I am under the influence of the Apple sect: my
computers are Apple (besides a Sun workstation I do not power on too
often) and I have an iPhone. Although I do not have plans of buying
an iPad (I have no use for it).</p>
    <p>I suppose I have to talk about my hobbies. I am quite boring in
that respect. I read books (mostly science fiction, but not exclusively),
watch movies from time to time and listen to rock music.</p>
