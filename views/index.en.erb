<h1>About me</h1>

<p class="lead">Hello! My name is Raúl Pedroche.  Pleased to meet you.
I am another student of
<a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/"
title="A Ruby Learning Hub">RubyLearning.org</a>'s
course "Programming for the Web with Ruby".</p>
<p>I like to be known by the handle "Pecio", but, truth be told,
nobody ever calls me that.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://raulete.tumblr.com/"
title="Raulete's rants about technology and everything">a
web log</a> that I do not update too much and
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pedrocheisback"
title="Raúl Pedroche (pedrocheisback) in Twitter">a
Twitter feed</a> that I update somewhat more but is not
too thrilling to read.</p>

<p>I am from Spain. I was raised in the northern coast, but
now I am living in the capital, Madrid, in the center of the
Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p>I am an unix administrator by training and trade, although I am
currently between jobs. I am using this free time to try to learn
more about programming. That is why I am taking Rubylearning.org
course.</p>
<p>A confession: I am a Ruby newbie (although this is not my first
contact with the language). But I think I am getting up to
speed fairly well.</p>
<p>I learnt Object Oriented programming quite a long
time ago (my main source was <a
href="http://books.google.es/books/about/Object_oriented_programming.html?id=U8AgAQAAIAAJ"
title="Object-oriented programming: an evolutionary approach">a book</a>
that used Objective-C back when nobody had heard of the
language) and I have tried to use the paradigm everytime I
have had to write some program. I have done OO programming
in C++, Perl, and Objective-C (with Cocoa) and have used OO
architectures in plain ANSI C.</p>
<p>Besides this course, I am doing a course on C# development. And
it is like night and day. Quite often, while doing the exercises on C#,
I cannot help but think how much easier and intuitive would it be in
Ruby (or maybe any dynamic language).</p>
<p>(That and the fact I miss Vim, although Intellisense is great.)</p>
<p>It can be said I am under the influence of the Apple sect: my
computers are Apple (besides a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_5/10"
title="Ultra 5/10 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Sun Ultra 10
workstation</a> I do not power on too
often) and I have an iPhone. Although I do not have plans of buying
an iPad (I have no use for it).</p>
<p>I suppose I have to talk about my hobbies. I am quite boring in
that respect. I read books (mostly science fiction, but not
exclusively), watch movies from time to time and listen to rock
music.</p>
